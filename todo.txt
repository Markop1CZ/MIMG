TODO:
Completely rewrite whole compressor.

- NumPy representation of image: h, w
- Respect this when iterating over image
- All functions' size arguments: a tuple (w, h)
- Reading and writing with file objects (.read() .write())
- Macroblock size: 8 (but can experiment)
- Use YCoCg-R, a reversible variation
- Before doing DCT, have values in range of -128 to 127 -> signed int8
- Work out a quantization matrix
- Zigzag before zlib
